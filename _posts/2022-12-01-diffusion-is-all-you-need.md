title: Diffusion Models are All You Need
description: The chemical space of molecular candidates is vast, and within this space, interesting and powerful drugs are waiting to be found. The use of machine learning has shown to be an effective method to speed up the process of discovering novel compounds, especially the use of (deep) generative models. The recent surge in graph generative models have opened up new avenues for exploring the chemical space of molecular candidates, enabling a more efficient and systematic exploration of the chemical space, increasing the chances of finding novel and potent molecules. One of the recent breakthroughs includes the use of diffusion models, which have proven to yield superior performance in molecular conformation tasks, among others. In this blog post, we aim to highlight one of them, which is the “GeoDiff: A Geometric Diffusion Model for Molecular Conformation Generation” paper by Xu et al. (2022). We aim to distill the paper in semi-layman terms, to provide researchers and practitioners with a deeper understanding of the (i) methodology and results and (ii) (societal) implications of this breakthrough in the field of drug discovery and (iii) discuss future applications in the field of (bio)medicine and healthcare.
